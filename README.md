# Firebase & Jetpack

This repo contains an Android app that demonstrates an (evolving) approach to
the use of Firebase along with some of Android's [Jetpack][2] components,
including ViewModel, LiveData, paging, data binding, and WorkManager.  Full
implementations are provided for [Realtime Database][3] and [Firestore][4].

## Live Demo

You can use a fully functioning version of this app by [installing it from the Play Store][1].

## Setup

Minimally, to get started:

1. Create a Firebase project
1. Enable Firestore and Realtime Database
1. Enable Google auth
1. Add add an Android app with the package name "com.hyperaware.android.firebasejetpack" and your SHA-1
1. Download google-services.json and place it in `android/app/google-services.json`
1. Download a service account from the console and place it in `backend/functions/service-account.json`
1. Initialize the backend code with `cd backend/functions; firebase init` and attach it to your project
1. Deploy the backend with `firebase deploy`
1. Run `node ./lib/tick.js --ticks 1` to bootstrap the database. Run with no args to tick infinitely.
1. Build and run the Android app to watch stock price changes in real time.

More details instructions and walkthrough coming later.
